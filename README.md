## Contributing

Feedback, improvements and corrections to the docs are welcome, specially typo and grammar fixes.
Feel free to submit your contributions via comments and/or pull requests.

Documents are plain markdown files. You don't need any special procedure for editing, just a text
editor. Previewing the HTML result requires building the docs.

## Building & previewing the docs

This is optional. Documentation sources are plain text files using the Markdown format.

The HTML documentation is built out of the md files using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org):

1. Ensure Python and pip are installed
2. Install MkDocs: `pip install mkdocs`
3. Install the extensions [markdown-icons](https://github.com/MadLittleMods/markdown-icons) and
	[mathjax](https://github.com/mayoff/python-markdown-mathjax) in the markdown extensions folder
4. Clone the repository from GitHub
5. Open a console at the repository folder, they type `mkdocs serve`
6. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser

Now you should see the documentation live in your browser. Reload the pages whenever you modify the
source files for viewing the changes.
